This project was developed by Michael Lew for the RTA 828 - Video Game Design course

The project makes use of imported assets from the Unreal Engine store. 
All creative rights belong to the creators of those assets or Epic games, and are available to use according to their respective licences.
I do not claim to own any of these assets, nor will this project be used for profit anyway.

I will include the imported packages/assets below:
Unreal Learning Kit Games
Unreal VR Template
Unreal VRBase
Sci-Fi Polar Facility
Construction_VOL2
heartbeat-01a
Syringe materials and shaders

If you are the creator of any assets I did not mention, please let me know so that I can give proper credit to you.
